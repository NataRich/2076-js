# Cyberfarm 2076
Cyberfarm2067 is a light web game that is very accessible. Here is an overview of the context:
Under the cruel exploitation of giant corporations, the lives of ordinary people are filled with untold suffering. Driven beyond endurance, thousands of people fled to the edge of the world and established a new society: the Day City.
It is a new era and everything starts from scratch. As the elected Day City mayor, the players need to develop productivity, deal with crises, and implement policy so that citizens can live and work in peace and contentment.
